Build your own router.  

## Motivation

Though services like tailscale makes it easy to secure your home network, I just wanted to build my own router to ensure autonomy and privacy. And to reduce the risk of a failure I want dedicated hardware instead of virtualizing it.

## Getting Started

### Buy the necessary Hardware

Then I am going to install Opnsense on it and configure the home network.
